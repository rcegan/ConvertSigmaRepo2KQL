# ConvertSigmaRepo2KQL
A small crappy script I wrote that converts the Sigma Windows Process Creation events to KQL via PySigma. Designed for usage in unattended CI/CD scenarios, so you'll want to modify the directories used in the script to reflect your own scenarios.

All credit goes to the PySigma project: https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma and the Defender backend, maintained by AttackIq: https://github.com/AttackIQ/pySigma-backend-microsoft365defender.
